# Caryatid Haskell interop example

This is a very quick-and-dirty demonstration of receiving typed messages from the Caryatid
framework in a Haskell program.  You'll need `cabal` installed to run it.

## To run

In one terminal run

```shell
$ cd examples/haskell
$ cabal run
```

In another, run the [typed](../typed) example:

```shell
$ cd examples/typed
$ cargo run
```
